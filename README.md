# P2 - Biker's World

A bike-sharing locator that helps to discover where are the bicycles located within the city.
They can be located via these search fields stated below so that search results can be precised to what they need.
<ul>
    <li>Country</li>
    <li>City</li>
    <li>State</li>
    <li>Town</li>
</ul>

And, it comes with a mini forum for commuters to view incidents report by other commuters around the globe.
They are arranged in these categories,
 <ul>
    <li>Theft</li>
    <li>Hazards</li>
    <li>Crash</li>
    <li>Infrastructure Issue</li>
    <li>Chop Shop</li>
</ul>

## UX   
 
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

 
### Existing Features

- Feature 1 - Users can view all the available bicycle locations around the globe (when they clicked on the)
- Feature 2 - 

[Future]
In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.
- Google Maps JavaScript API
- API(s)
    - 
    - BikeWise

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Index (index.html)
    1. Launch the html page by previewing it on a new tab in browser.
2. App (app.js)
    1.



In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.


You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.


If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

- The website is deployed on Github pages, and develope on AWS Cloud 9 IDE platform.


This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
